4a. Take a look at number of responses for each question in a temporary dataframe, we want to select on people who have used OUD but not on a daily bases, since those people are most likely undiagnosed with OUD.

we want our control to be everyone who has taken opioid
exclude those who have taken opioid on a daily basis, since they are most likely undiagonosed cases
exclude those who have answered "Never" to taking opioids
